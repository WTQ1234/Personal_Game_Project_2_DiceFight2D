# Personal_Game_Project_2_DiceFight2D

A personal game project in Unity.

Not for commercial use, the particle effects is from internet.

I made it in the booom game jam for 3 weeks (2023/9/20-2023/10/11).

There are 6 people in the team, most of them are students.
2 2D-artist, 1 3D-artist, 1 musician, 2 programmer.

Because of the copyright, I remove the odin inspector plugin, you can get it from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041

downland the package above, and drag into the project, then it will work.
