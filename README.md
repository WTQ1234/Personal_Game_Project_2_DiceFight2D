# Personal_Game_Project_2_DiceFight2D

A personal game project in Unity.

Not for commercial use, the particle effects is from internet.

I made it in the booom gamejam 2023/10.

Because of the copyright, I remove the odin inspector plugin, you can get it from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041

downland the package above, and drag into the project, then it will work.

View it in the video: 

Play it by download in google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15pTn2z-RLUVNeBW8rqLa-5zurQUp-6ml/view?usp=sharing
